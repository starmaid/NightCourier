# Plan

This is the development plan for the game. I am ignoring github issues for now because I'm the only one working on it, and I can work from a list just fine.

## Minimum Viable Product

- Two limited-scope locations

    - Town at the base of the mountains
    - Inland City
    
- Two gamemodes

    - DEFEND: Destroy all attacking enemies
    - ATTACK: Destroy priority target and escape

- Four missions:

    One of each type on each map.

- Five Planes

    These will be shared by you and the enemy. They will have slightly different stats.
    
- Three weapons

    - Cannon
    - Tracking Missile
    - Railgun
    
    There will be no upgrades.
    
- Main menu

    This is a single, basic menu for entering the game, selecing a mission, and selecting a plane. 
    
    For the MVP, there are no saved games. You have access to every plane and every mission
    
- Controls are not able to be changed
- Two graphics modes, HIGH and LOW

    This one is subject to change. If the lowest power PC I am aiming for can play the high graphics, this is not needed.


## The Ultimate Version

- Single, massive map with 10 named locations

    I want the user to actually have to fly between locations. This may be supplemented with a fast travel, but I feel like that would make the world much cooler.
    
- More gamemodes

    - DEFEND: Destroy all attacking enemies.
    - ATTACK: Destroy priority target and escape.
    - DELIVER: Go from one location to another without dying.
    - RECON: View something and return to the starting location.
    - ESCORT: Protect friendlies while in transit
    
- Story-driven missions

    I don't know how long the game would be. 20 missions? Maybe a 10 hour playtime?
    
- More planes

    Ten maybe?
    
- Seven weapons

    - Cannon (1,2,3)
    - Tracking Missile (1,2,3)
    - Railgun (Its always an instakill)

- Main Menu

    Saved game that you progress and unlock. Select loadout. Start Missions in order.
    
- Controls can be rebound
- Actual graphics settings
