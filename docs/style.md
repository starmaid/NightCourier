Star Fox for the SNES,

## Prior Art

[Whisker Squadron](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303400/Whisker_Squadron/) is a modern, lo-poly, combat-on-rails flight game with some new cool styling. I like it, but i wish it leaned harder into a distinctive visual style, and like the freedom of open air combat.

[Project Wingman](https://store.steampowered.com/app/895870/Project_Wingman/) is the game I'm ripping most of the controls and combat from (not like its unique, ace combat, metalstorm, etc!). Arcade air combat just kicks ass.

[Vec9](http://vec9.com/) is just a dope game that ive never played because its actually an [FPGA driving a real vector monitor](https://www.andrewreitano.com/posts/vec9/) so you have to play it on the one (1) cabinet that exists.


## Color Palettes
