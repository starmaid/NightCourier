# NightCourier

![](/img/concept1.png)

NightCourier is a synthwave-style arcade flight combat game made in Unreal Engine.

This is my first from-scratch game project.

### Goals

- Go through every step of the game development cycle BEFORE BURNING OUT
- Familiarize myself with Unreal Engine (mostly the parts I don't get exposure to at work)
- Avoid that 'UE Look'
- Make a single-player game that my friends can download and play
